## Quick Start

### Basic Investment Analysis

```python
import asyncio
from egile_investor import ai_investment_analysis

async def main():
    # Analyze a specific stock
    result = await ai_investment_analysis("Analyze AAPL stock for investment potential")
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Using the Investment Agent

```python
from egile_investor import AIInvestmentAgent

async def main():
    async with AIInvestmentAgent() as agent:
        # Get stock analysis
        analysis = await agent.analyze("Analyze TSLA stock performance and provide buy/sell recommendation")
        
        # Analyze portfolio
        portfolio_analysis = await agent.analyze("Analyze my portfolio risk and suggest optimizations")
        
        print(analysis)
        print(portfolio_analysis)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Advanced Stock Screening with S&P 500 Support

```python
from egile_investor import AIInvestmentAgent

async def main():
    async with AIInvestmentAgent() as agent:
        # Screen S&P 500 stocks for value opportunities
        sp500_results = await agent.call_tool("screen_stocks", {
            "criteria": {
                "pe_ratio": {"max": 18},        # P/E ratio under 18
                "dividend_yield": {"min": 0.02}, # Dividend yield above 2%
                "roe": {"min": 0.12}            # ROE above 12%
            },
            "use_sp500": True,  # Screen all S&P 500 stocks
            "max_results": 10
        })
        
        # Alternative: use universe parameter
        results = await agent.call_tool("screen_stocks", {
            "criteria": {"pe_ratio": {"max": 20}},
            "universe": "sp500",  # Options: "sp500", "major", or custom list
            "max_results": 5
        })
        
        # Screen only major stocks (default behavior)
        major_results = await agent.call_tool("screen_stocks", {
            "criteria": {"market_cap": {"min": 100000000000}},
            "universe": "major",
            "max_results": 10
        })

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Generic MCP Agent (Works with Any MCP Server)

The Generic MCP Agent works like GitHub Copilot - it can automatically discover and work with any MCP server:

```python
from egile_investor import GenericMCPAgent, generic_mcp_request

# Simple usage with any MCP server
async def main():
    # Works with investment server
    result = await generic_mcp_request(
        "Find value stocks with PE ratio under 15 and dividend yield above 3%",
        server_command="python -m egile_investor.server"
    )
    
    # Works with any other MCP server
    result = await generic_mcp_request(
        "List all Python files in the project",
        server_command="python -m file_server"  # hypothetical file server
    )
    
    # Manual control for advanced usage
    async with GenericMCPAgent(server_command="python -m any_server") as agent:
        # Agent automatically discovers available tools
        print(f"Found {len(agent.available_tools)} tools")
        
        # Uses LLM reasoning to create execution plans
        result = await agent.execute_request("Do something intelligent with available tools")
        
        print(f"Execution plan: {len(result['execution_plan'])} steps")
        print(f"Success rate: {result['success_rate']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Report Generation with File Output

The `generate_report` tool now automatically saves reports to files:

```python
from egile_investor import AIInvestmentAgent

async def main():
    async with AIInvestmentAgent() as agent:
        # Generate report and save to custom file
        report = await agent.call_tool("generate_report", {
            "topic": "AAPL Stock Analysis",
            "content": {"analysis": "Detailed AAPL analysis..."},
            "filename": "aapl_analysis.md"  # Custom filename
        })
        
        # Generate report with automatic timestamp filename
        report = await agent.call_tool("generate_report", {
            "topic": "Market Overview",
            "content": {"market_data": "Current market conditions..."}
            # Will create: report_20241224-1430.md
        })

asyncio.run(main())
```

### MCP Server Usage

Start the MCP server:

```bash
egile-investor-server
```

Or programmatically:

```python
from egile_investor.server import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
